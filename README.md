# üõ≥Ô∏è Titanic Survival Prediction
![Titanic Centennial](https://www.usni.org/sites/default/files/styles/hero_image/public/magazine_uploads/images/ProtasioFOMA12.jpg?itok=8aFRMKPz)

A data science project analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns and build predictive models using Python.

---

## Project Overview

This project applies statistical analysis and machine learning to the Titanic passenger dataset. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

---

## Files Included

- `train.csv`: Main dataset with passenger details and survival labels.
- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all code ‚Äî from EDA to model evaluation.
- `USAGE.md`: Instructions for installing dependencies and running the notebook.
- `README.md`: This project overview file.

## üìä Highlights

- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin`.
- Visualized key survival trends (gender, class, age).
- Achieved ~80% accuracy with Random Forest model.
- Built interactive prediction logic based on custom passenger input.
- Displayed model results with a Plotly heatmap.
