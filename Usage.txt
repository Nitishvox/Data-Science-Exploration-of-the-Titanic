Titanic Survival Prediction Project ‚Äì Usage Guide

This guide explains how to set up, explore, and run predictions using the Titanic dataset in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn plotly

  Files Overview
train.csv: Training dataset with survival labels

titanic_model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and prediction logic

USAGE.md: Documentation file explaining usage

Optionally: requirements.txt for dependency tracking

Running the Project
Open the Notebook Launch the Jupyter environment and open titanic_model.ipynb.

Load Dataset Make sure train.csv is in the same directory.

Run Cells Execute all cells in order‚Äîfrom loading the data to EDA and model training.

Make Predictions

Use interactive input cells to simulate survival predictions.

Optionally modify new_passenger data in the model cell for custom predictions.

Key Features
Missing value treatment using median/mode strategy

Visualizations with Seaborn and Plotly (interactive heatmap)

Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

User input prediction logic via the trained model

Output Examples
Accuracy scores and classification reports for each model

Interactive confusion matrix visualization

Live prediction result (e.g., ‚Äú‚úÖ Prediction: This passenger survived.‚Äù)
